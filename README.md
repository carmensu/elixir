# We love each other, but just don't know how (Project Elixir)

#### This project is inspired by the story of Elisa Lam. 
#### After knowing her story, I feel there is a lot that I resonate with her. 
#### I'm an immigrant with a Southeast Asian background. Project Elixir serves as a roadmap to understand myself and hopefully a compass that helps me navigate through life. 
#### This is just my story, if you are suffering from any conditions, please seek help!!!
