# We love each other, but just don't know how (Project Elixir)

## This blog is inspired the story of Elisa Lam. 
## After knowing her story, I feel there is a lot that I resonate with her. 
## I'm an immigrant with a Southeast Asian background. Back in 2018, I was diagnosed with depression and psychosis. Project Elixir serves as a roadmap to understand myself and hopefully a compass that helps me navigate through life. 
## This is just my story, if you are suffering from any conditions, please seek help!!!
